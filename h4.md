## A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

Access control is a policy to ensure that users can't act outside of their intended permissions.

### Access Control Vulnerabilities:
- **Authorization bypass** through URL manipulation.
- **Violation of least privilege**: Access granted too broadly rather than specific to users and their roles.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Using user-supplied input to access objects directly.
- **Missing access control APIs**: Lack of POST, PUT, and DELETE request protections.
- **Unauthorized actions**: Acting as an unauthorized user or admin.
- **Metadata manipulation**: Modifying tokens and cookies.
- **Untrusted API access**: Allowing API access from untrusted origins.
- **Unauthorized page access**: Accessing authentication pages without proper verification.

### How to Prevent:
- Implement **rate limiting** for APIs.
- Enable **access control logging**.
- Ensure proper **session management**.
- Use **ownership-based access control**.

## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

This occurs due to the complexity of modern, highly configurable software.

### Vulnerabilities:
- Unnecessary **features, ports, or privileges** are enabled.
- **New security features** disabled after upgrades.
- **Outdated or vulnerable software** with known weaknesses.
- Default accounts and passwords remain **unchanged**.

### Prevention Guidelines:
- Use a **secure installation process**: Set up environments with a repeatable process and automate to save time.
- **Only install what is needed**: Remove unnecessary features, programs, or settings.
- **Regularly update** software and components.
- **Separate application components or users** for better security.

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

A persistent issue in application security, difficult to test and assess.

### When You Are Vulnerable:
- You don't know the **versions** of all components (client-side and server-side), including nested dependencies.
- Your **software, OS, servers, or libraries** are outdated, unsupported, or unpatched.
- You don't scan for **vulnerabilities** or subscribe to security bulletins.
- You don't **update** systems regularly, leaving them exposed.
- **Developers fail to test** updated libraries for compatibility.
- **Misconfigured components**, as described in A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration.

### How to Prevent:
- Use **patch management**.
- Obtain components from **trusted sources** using secure connections.
- Monitor for **unmaintained components** that no longer receive security patches.
- Implement **ongoing monitoring** of components.

## A03:2021 – Injection

### Vulnerability Description:
An application is vulnerable to injection when:
- **User input** is not properly validated, filtered, or sanitized.
- **Dynamic queries** or non-parameterized commands are used without escaping malicious input.
- **Hostile data** is used in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to access sensitive records.
- **Malicious data** is concatenated with SQL, command-line, or other dynamic queries.

### Common Types of Injection:
- SQL, NoSQL, OS Command, ORM, LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) injection.

### How to Prevent:
- Use **safe APIs** to avoid direct interaction with interpreters.
- Apply **input validation**.
- **Escape special characters** in queries.
- Use **LIMIT** or other controls to minimize the scope of data retrieval in case of SQL injection.
