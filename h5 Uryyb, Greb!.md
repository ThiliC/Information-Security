**Terminology in Applied Cryptography**  
- **Sender and Receiver**: When a sender wants to send a message to a receiver, it must be secured to ensure that an eavesdropper cannot read the message.

**Message and Encryption**  
- A message is **plaintext** (also called clear text).
- The process of disguising plaintext to hide its substance, turning it into ciphertext, is called **encryption**.
- The encrypted message, unreadable without decryption, is called **ciphertext**.
- The art and science of securing messages is called **cryptography**.
- The art and science of breaking ciphertext is known as **cryptanalysis**.
- The overall study of secure communications, including both cryptography and cryptanalysis, is called **cryptology**.

**Example**:  
If a sender needs to send "HELLO" **(plaintext)**, it is encrypted to "IFMMP" **(ciphertext)**. The process of disguising the message to hide its meaning is called **encryption**. Securing the message is referred to as **cryptography**. If someone figures out that "IFMMP" means "HELLO," they are performing **cryptanalysis**. The overall study of securing and breaking codes is called **cryptology**.
