### x) Read or Watch and Summarize.



### a) Install Hashcat. 
- **Cracking Passwords with Hashcat**
  Installed Hashcat
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
  ```
  ```
  $ mkdir hashed
  $ cd hashed
  ```

### b)  Cracking this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

This checks the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96.
```
$ hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
```

The output will show possible hash types, like:

MD2
MD5 (which is number 0 for Hashcat)
MD4 (which is number 900 for Hashcat)
The -m parameter number from hashid is the same one to use with Hashcat to crack the password.

Usually, the correct type will be in the top three results. If not, you can guess based on where you got the hash from (like Windows or Linux).

For this example, MD5 is a common type to try first because many hashes are in this format.

  ```
  $ hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
  ```
To find the cracked password from the hashcat output, I look at the line starting with "Candidates" or "Recovered".

Recovered: This shows that one password has been successfully cracked:
1/1 means it cracked 1 password out of 1 total hash.
Candidates:
In the line Candidates.#1....: dispenser5 -> disney land, it shows the transition between different guesses.

The final part, "disney land", is the correct cracked password.
So, the cracked password is **"disney land"**
