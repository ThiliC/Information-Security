**2.3 One-Way Functions**
One-way functions are special math functions that are easy to use in one direction but very hard to reverse. Here are the main points:

- Easy to Calculate: You can quickly get the output from the input.
- Hard to Reverse: It’s very difficult to figure out the original input just from the output.
- Collision Resistance: It should be tough to find two different inputs that give you the same output.
These functions are important for keeping data secure and are used in many encryption methods.

**2.4 One-Way Hash Functions**
One-way hash functions are a specific type of one-way function with some extra features:

- Fixed-Length Output: They take any size of input and turn it into a fixed-length output (called a hash value).
- Sensitive to Changes: If you change even a tiny bit of the input, the output will change a lot.
- Data Protection: Hash functions are used to check that data hasn’t been changed and to keep information safe.
These functions are essential for things like password storage and digital signatures.

**Conclusion**
Both one-way functions and one-way hash functions are crucial in cryptography. They help secure and verify data while making it hard for unauthorized users to access the original information.


### a) Install Hashcat. 
- **Cracking Passwords with Hashcat**
  Installed Hashcat
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
  ```
  ```
  $ mkdir hashed
  $ cd hashed
  ```

### b)  Cracking this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

This checks the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96.
```
$ hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
```

The output will show possible hash types, like:

MD2
MD5 (which is number 0 for Hashcat)
MD4 (which is number 900 for Hashcat)
The -m parameter number from hashid is the same one to use with Hashcat to crack the password.

Usually, the correct type will be in the top three results. If not, you can guess based on where you got the hash from (like Windows or Linux).

For this example, MD5 is a common type to try first because many hashes are in this format.

  ```
  $ hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
  ```
To find the cracked password from the hashcat output, I look at the line starting with "Candidates" or "Recovered".

Recovered: This shows that one password has been successfully cracked:
1/1 means it cracked 1 password out of 1 total hash.
Candidates:
In the line Candidates.#1....: dispenser5 -> disney land, it shows the transition between different guesses.

The final part, "disney land", is the correct cracked password.
So, the cracked password is **"disney land"**
