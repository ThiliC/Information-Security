## a) Bandit oh-five

Before doing the Bandit oh-five, I needed to install OpenSSH. On Debian, SSH client tools should be installed by default. To check that, we can run:

- `ssh -V`

It showed it was not installed, so I installed it using:

- `sudo apt install openssh-client`

Then I checked again and continued to do the Bandit Level 0.

## Bandit Level 0

Log into the Bandit Game using SSH. This can be written in two ways: 
- `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

or 
- `ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0`

Then I was able to log into the Game. Next, it asked for the password: Since the username is bandit0, the password is `bandit0`.

Now the password for Level 01 is in the "readme" file. 

To list files in a directory we need to use the command 

- `ls`

To display the content of the file, 

- `cat readme`

The password for Bandit Level 01 was displayed. To copy the password, use **Ctrl+Shift+C**. Then I logged out from Level 0 using 
`exit`

## Level 01 - Level 02

Again, to log in I used 

- `ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit1`

For the password, I pasted the password I copied in Level 0 using **Ctrl+Shift+V**.

To list the files in the home directory, use `ls`. The file was located in the "-" file name. 

To work with dashed filenames in Linux, we should tell it not to interpret anything after the special character. There are two ways to resolve this: 

- `cat -- -abc.txt` (Option #1) 

- `cat ./-abc.txt` (Option #2)

**Reference**: [TecMint](https://www.tecmint.com/special-character-filenames-linux/). 

Here I used,

- `cat ./-`

Then the password for Level 02 was displayed. I copied it and exited from Level 01.

## Level 02 - Level 03

Logged into Level 02 using,

- `ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit2`

The password was pasted from Level 01. To list the files in the home directory, use `ls`. 

The password was stored in the file called "spaces in this filename" located in the home directory. Since there are spaces in the file name, I had to escape the spaces or use quotes to access. 

- `cat "spaces in this filename"` (Option #1) 

- `cat spaces\in\this\filename` (Option #2) 

Then I copied the password displayed and logged out from Level 02.

## Level 03 - Level 04

Logged in as,

- `ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit3`
  
The password was pasted from Level 02. Level 04 password is stored in a hidden file in the "inhere" directory.

To change to a specific directory, 

- `cd <directory name>`

**Reference**: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=directories-changing-another-directory-cd-command).

Here I used,

- `cd inhere`

To list the files including hidden, I used,

`ls -a` and `cat .hidden` Then I copied the displayed password and logged out.

## Level 04

Again, I logged into Level 04 using 

- `ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit4`

I pasted the password found in Level 03.
