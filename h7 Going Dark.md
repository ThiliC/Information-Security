 What is Tor?

 Tor is a free, open source software and network that enables anonymous web browsing. 
 Tor directs internet traffic via a voulanteer overlay network that consists of more than seven thousand relays. It can help to use the internet with more privacy. 
 But according to the article, it can't prevent someone moitoring my network traffic and the network traffic of the internet service I am communicating with. It      means that the design relies on at least one side of the connection not being watched by the person i am trying to keep my information private from. 

Tor is easy to use. 
- The easiest way to get started with Tor is to download the Tor Browser Bundle.
- Tor is with Tails. (when you shut down Tails **forget** everything that was done while running)

  **Important**
  - Always keep software upto date.
  - If you log into Google, Facebook via TOR, those services can see your communications from their systems.
  - Adversary who can see both sides can be perform statistical analysis to confirm that the the traffic belongs to you.
